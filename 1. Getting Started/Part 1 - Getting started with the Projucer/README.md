# Projucer Tutorials - Part 1: Getting Started with the Projucer

## Summary

These notes document the initial steps taken in "Part 1 - Getting Started with the Projucer." The focus is on creating a new GUI project, launching it in Visual Studio 2022, and exploring project files.

## Key Points

- **New GUI Project:**
  - Created a new GUI project as suggested by the tutorial documentation.

- **Target IDE:**
  - Set the target IDE to Visual Studio 2022.

- **Project Launch:**
  - Successfully launched the project using the launch button following the provided directions.

- **Opening via .jucer File:**
  - Managed to open the project using the .jucer file.

- **PIP File Creation:**
  - Couldn't find any PIP files, so created a generic PIP file to understand its structure. It is essentially a generic .h file with project setup information.
  
- **Documentation Tracking:**
  - Created a "Terms" document in the main folder to track new information, especially related to PIP files.
  
- **Understanding PIP Files:**
  - Referenced the website, which states that PIP files are header files with the .h extension. They provide metadata to the Projucer, enabling the automatic creation of a project with the correct modules and exporters from a single file.

- **Project Continuation:**
  - Moved GUI_Project files to Part 2 for the continuation of the tutorial. (Note: GUI_Project files will be continued in Part 2)

I've created a new GUI project here as suggested by the tutorial documentation. 
Target IDE is Visual Studio 2022.
I was successful in launching the project via the launch button as per the directions. 
Was able to open via .jucer file
Was not able to find any PIP files so I created a generic PIP file so that I could see what it looked like.  It is basically just a generic .h file that has project setup information. 
Created Terms doc in main to track this kinds of new information
(Website states:  These are essentially header files with the usual .h extension that provide metadata to the Projucer in order to automatically create a project with the correct modules and exporters from a single file.)

GUI_Project files moved to Part 2 for the continuation of the tutorial.
